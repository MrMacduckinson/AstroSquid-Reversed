# Validation scope

Target: AstroSquid 1.1 reconstructed native Intel application, macOS 10.13.6.
Original execution references: PowerPC G5, Mac OS X 10.4.11, original 1.1 CFM/PEF.
No game, GUI, OpenGL or audio test is launched on the primary development Mac.

## Checks performed

- `./test.sh --native-only` on Intel: portable behavior fixtures from original
  execution, including all 29 AI scripts, weapons, targeting, damage, pickups,
  player/scenery, visuals, special attacks, nested scheduling, campaign, HUD,
  score editing and transitions.
- `./test.sh` portable/resource checks: all 8126 map entries and cross-links,
  all 54 atlas dimensions, sound PCM hashes and all 74 original QuickDraw rasters.
  Python checks require Pillow; Intel's native-only run explicitly omits them.
- Actual application `--self-test DIRECTORY` on Intel: menus, stage cards,
  settings and score entry handlers, movement, all four special families, beams,
  projectile hits, effects, boss defeat/score, stage selection, GL rendering and
  music advancement. Additional assertions cover normal death/respawn, retained
  base weapon, upgrade reset, relative blink and invulnerability, scenery shield
  effects, modifier-key pause/resume and release order, and elapsed pause time.
  The combat fixture grants a shield; this is not an unaided playthrough.
- Actual write/reload in two separate Intel processes with an isolated temporary
  bundle identifier: reassigned key, filtering, both volumes, unlocked stage and
  score survive restart. Probe defaults are removed, player defaults untouched.
- Original G5 hit-effect oracle: 1980 mixed projectile/scenery lifecycle ticks,
  matching sound cue/pan, new effect layers 7/8, existing effect reset and resize,
  follow position, animation deadlines and removal. See `validation/hit-visual.json`.
- Complete Intel controlled campaign: real AI, collisions, map spawning and
  transitions through 1A–8B and 9B, then all four ending pages. Pilot replenishes
  shield, uses weapon 53 and steers using normal directional inputs; no stage
  teleport. This proves the complete route works, not ordinary-player difficulty.

## Controlled original-renderer comparison

`tests/framebuffer_reference_metrics.json` records 12 complete 640×380 playfield
composites. The G5 executes the original unmodified renderer and sprite drawer;
the Intel harness duplicates source-cross-checked port sprite/star math with
the same RGBA atlases and scene inputs (controlled dithering disabled). It is a standalone renderer check, not a production
application capture. Both representatives are included under `validation/`.

Across the two GPUs, every frame has at least 99.46% of pixels within 2/255 RGB,
and mean per-channel error is at most 0.252/255. Sparse star/nearest-filter edges
can differ sharply by one pixel. The comparison covers selected stages, camera
offsets, filters and overlapping layers; it excludes live campaign, HUD, menus
and randomized beam frames. Actual production rendering is checked separately by
the application self-test. No pixel-identity claim is made.

## Reproduce runtime checks on the target Mac

```sh
./test.sh --native-only
./build.sh
'build/AstroSquid.app/Contents/MacOS/AstroSquid' --self-test /tmp/astrosquid-selftest
'build/AstroSquid.app/Contents/MacOS/AstroSquid' --campaign-test /tmp/astrosquid-campaign
```

Both application checks write JSON evidence and exit with a failing status if a
required assertion fails. Full campaign takes several minutes on the reference
iMac. Do not run two interactive application checks simultaneously.

The final Intel campaign result is `validation/campaign.json`: 17 stages,
214398 simulation ticks and ending reached. `validation/runtime.json` records
the final actual-application self-test; assertions also run for the normal
lifecycle and input cases described above.

## Boundaries

This is reconstructed source and an unsigned application. It is not the original
FutureBASIC project, a PPC build, or a claim of support for every macOS version.
No unaided full playthrough or pixel-identical live campaign capture across GPUs
has been established. Native routine comparisons, controlled rendering and a
complete assisted route provide separate evidence for their respective scopes.
